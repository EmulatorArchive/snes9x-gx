Here's some basic instructions on compiling SNES9x GX. You don't need to be a programmer to follow these instructions but you should have some basic computer know-how. There's a few reasons you might want to do this:

 # To use the latest version of the emulator (note that beta versions may be unstable)
 # To access roms/saves from Windows File Sharing (SMB) - just edit s9xconfig.cpp
 # Make your own custom changes

= Instructions =

 # Download the source either from the [http://code.google.com/p/snes9x-gx/downloads/list Downloads] page, or the latest directly from SVN.
 # Download and install [http://www.devkitpro.com devkitPro]. You only need to install devkitPPC.
 # Download the [http://snes9x-gx.googlecode.com/files/devkitPro.zip Snes9x devkitPro libraries] from the Downloads page, and overwrite the libraries in your devkitPro installation folder.
 # Run Programmer's Notepad (installed with devkitPro)
 # Find the Makefile from the source you downloaded. Click Tools > Make.
 # You're done!
