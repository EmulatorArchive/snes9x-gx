Here's some basic instructions on compiling SNES9x GX. You don't need to be a programmer to follow these instructions but you should have some basic computer know-how. There's a few reasons you might want to do this:

1. To use the latest version of the emulator (note that beta versions may be unstable)
2. To access ROMS/saves from Windows File Sharing (SMB) - just edit s9xconfig.cpp
3. Make your own custom changes

= Instructions =

1. Download the source either from the Downloads page, or the latest directly from SVN.
2. Download and install devkitPro (www.devkitpro.com). You only need to install devkitPPC.
3. Download the devkitPro libraries (devkitPro.zip) from the Downloads page, and overwrite the libraries in your devkitPro installation folder.
4. Run Programmer's Notepad (installed with devkitPro)
5. Find the Makefile from the source you downloaded. Click Tools > Make.
6. You're done!
